        Returns all the transactions related to a balance account, account
        holder, or balance platform.


        When making this request, you must include at least one of the
        following:

        - `balanceAccountId`

        - `accountHolderId`

        - `balancePlatform`.


        This endpoint supports cursor-based pagination. The response returns the
        first page of results, and returns links to the next and previous pages
        when applicable. You can use the links to page through the results.

        Starts a request to transfer funds to [balance
        accounts](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/balanceplatform/latest/post/balanceAccounts),
        [transfer
        instruments](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/legalentity/latest/post/transferInstruments),
        or third-party bank accounts. Adyen sends the outcome of the transfer
        request through webhooks.


        To use this endpoint, you need an additional role for your API
        credential and transfers must be enabled for the source balance account.
        Your Adyen contact will set these up for you.
