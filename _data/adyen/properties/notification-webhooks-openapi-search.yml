        Adyen sends this webhook when a payment authorisation, a refund, or a
        funds transfer has been initiated. This webhook only informs your server
        of requests. For the actual fund movements, you'll get the information
        from the subsequent outgoing or incoming transfer webhooks.

         To differentiate the requests, check the content of the webhook.

        * For payments, the webhook contains the authorisation result,
        information about the processing merchant, and shows a negative amount.

         * For refunds, the webhook contains to which payment instrument the funds will be refunded, and shows a positive amount.

        * For outgoing or incoming fund transfers, the webhook shows a positive
        or negative amount depending on the direction of the transfer, and only
        includes information about the balance account.
