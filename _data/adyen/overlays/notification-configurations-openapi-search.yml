      summary: Subscribe to notifications
      description: >-
        Creates a subscription to notifications informing you of events on your
        platform. After the subscription is created, the events specified in the
        configuration will be sent to the URL specified in the configuration.
        Subscriptions must be configured on a per-event basis (as opposed to,
        for example, a per-account holder basis), so all event notifications of
        a marketplace and of a given type will be sent to the same endpoint(s).
        A marketplace may have multiple endpoints if desired; an event
        notification may be sent to as many or as few different endpoints as
        configured.
