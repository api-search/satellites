        <p>Issue a credit note to adjust the amount of a finalized invoice. For
        a <code>status=open</code> invoice, a credit note reduces

        its <code>amount_due</code>. For a <code>status=paid</code> invoice, a
        credit note does not affect its <code>amount_due</code>. Instead, it can
        result

        in any combination of the following:</p>


        <ul>

        <li>Refund: create a new refund (using <code>refund_amount</code>) or
        link an existing refund (using <code>refund</code>).</li>

        <li>Customer balance credit: credit the customer’s balance (using
        <code>credit_amount</code>) which will be automatically applied to their
        next invoice when it’s finalized.</li>

        <li>Outside of Stripe credit: record the amount that is or will be
        credited outside of Stripe (using <code>out_of_band_amount</code>).</li>

        </ul>


        <p>For post-payment credit notes the sum of the refund, credit and
        outside of Stripe amounts must equal the credit note total.</p>


        <p>You may issue multiple credit notes for an invoice. Each credit note
        will increment the invoice’s
        <code>pre_payment_credit_notes_amount</code>

        or <code>post_payment_credit_notes_amount</code> depending on its
        <code>status</code> at the time of credit note creation.</p>
