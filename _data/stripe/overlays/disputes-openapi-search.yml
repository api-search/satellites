        <p>When you get a dispute, contacting your customer is always the best
        first step. If that doesnâ€™t work, you can submit evidence to help us
        resolve the dispute in your favor. You can do this in your <a
        href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes">dashboard</a>, but if you
        prefer, you can use the API to submit evidence programmatically.</p>


        <p>Depending on your dispute type, different evidence fields will give
        you a better chance of winning your dispute. To figure out which
        evidence fields to provide, see our <a
        href="/docs/disputes/categories">guide to dispute types</a>.</p>

        evidence to submit and are essentially dismissing the dispute,
        acknowledging it as lost.</p>
