        <p>To send funds to your own bank account, create a new payout object.
        Your <a href="#balance">Stripe balance</a> must cover the payout amount.
        If it doesn’t, you receive an “Insufficient Funds” error.</p>


        <p>If your API key is in test mode, money won’t actually be sent, though
        every other action occurs as if you’re in live mode.</p>


        <p>If you create a manual payout on a Stripe account that uses multiple
        payment source types, you need to specify the source type balance that
        the payout draws from. The <a href="#balance_object">balance object</a>
        details available and pending amounts by source type.</p>
