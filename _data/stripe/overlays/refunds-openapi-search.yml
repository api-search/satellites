        <p>When you create a new refund, you must specify a Charge or a
        PaymentIntent object on which to create it.</p>


        <p>Creating a new refund will refund a charge that has previously been
        created but not yet refunded.

        Funds will be refunded to the credit or debit card that was originally
        charged.</p>


        <p>You can optionally refund only part of a charge.

        You can do so multiple times, until the entire charge has been
        refunded.</p>


        <p>Once entirely refunded, a charge can’t be refunded again.

        This method will raise an error when called on an already-refunded
        charge,

        or when trying to refund more money than is left on a charge.</p>
