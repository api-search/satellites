        For example, if you pass the <strong>source</strong> parameter, that
        becomes the customer’s active source (e.g., a card) to be used for all
        charges in the future. When you update a customer to a new valid card

        <p>Cancels a customer’s subscription. If you set the
        <code>at_period_end</code> parameter to <code>true</code>, the
        subscription will remain active until the end of the period, at which
        point it will be canceled and not renewed. Otherwise, with the default
        <code>false</code> value, the subscription is terminated immediately. In
        either case, the customer will not be charged again for the
        subscription.</p>


        <p>Note, however, that any pending invoice items that you’ve created
        will still be charged for at the end of the period, unless manually <a
        href="#delete_invoiceitem">deleted</a>. If you’ve set the subscription
        to cancel at the end of the period, any pending prorations will also be
        left in place and collected at the end of the period. But if the
        subscription is set to cancel immediately, pending prorations will be
        removed.</p>


        <p>By default, upon subscription cancellation, Stripe will stop
        automatic collection of all finalized invoices for the customer. This is
        intended to prevent unexpected payment attempts after the customer has
        canceled a subscription. However, you can resume automatic collection of
        the invoices manually after subscription cancellation to have us
        proceed. Or, you could check for unpaid invoices before allowing the
        customer to cancel the subscription at all.</p>

          description: >-
            Tracks the most recent state change on any invoice belonging to the
            customer. Paying an invoice or marking it uncollectible via the API
            will set this field to false. An automatic payment failure or
            passing the `invoice.due_date` will set this field to `true`.


            If an invoice becomes uncollectible by
            [dunning](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/automatic-collection),
            `delinquent` doesn't reset to `false`.


            If you care whether the customer has paid their most recent
            subscription invoice, use `subscription.status` instead. Paying or
            marking uncollectible any customer invoice regardless of whether it
            is the latest invoice for a subscription will always set this field
            to `false`.

            For bank accounts, possible values are `new`, `validated`,

            hasn't had any activity or validation performed is `new`. If Stripe
            can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be
            `validated`. Note that there often isn’t enough information to know
            (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always
            run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank
            account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for
            any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be
            `verification_failed`. If a payout sent to this bank account fails,
            we'll set the status to `errored` and will not continue to send
            [scheduled payouts](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts#payout-schedule)
            until the bank details are updated.


            For external accounts, possible values are `new`, `errored` and
            `verification_failed`. If a payouts fails, the status is set to
            `errored` and scheduled payouts are stopped until account details
            are updated. In India, if we can't [verify the owner of the bank
            account](https://support.stripe.com/questions/bank-account-ownership-verification),
            we'll set the status to `verification_failed`. Other validations
            aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for
            payouts. This means the other statuses don't apply.

            Possible values are `incomplete`, `incomplete_expired`, `trialing`,
            `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, or `unpaid`. 


            For `collection_method=charge_automatically` a subscription moves
            into `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt fails. A
            subscription in this state can only have metadata and default_source
            updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into
            an `active` state. If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours,
            the subscription transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is a
            terminal state, the open invoice will be voided and no further
            invoices will be generated. 


            A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and
            moves to `active` when the trial period is over. 


            If subscription `collection_method=charge_automatically`, it becomes
            `past_due` when payment is required but cannot be paid (due to
            failed payment or awaiting additional user actions). Once Stripe has
            exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription will become
            `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings). 


            If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes
            `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and
            `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional
            deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of
            `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be
            created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving
            updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to
            reopen and pay their closed invoices.

            Use `allow_incomplete` to create subscriptions with
            `status=incomplete` if the first invoice cannot be paid. Creating
            subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where
            additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice.
            For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to
            complete payment. See the [SCA Migration
            Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication)
            for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.


            Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with
            `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment,
            otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to
            `status=active` when successfully confirming the payment intent on
            the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where
            additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice.
            Such as failed payments, [SCA
            regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication),
            or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the
            payment intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions
            transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal
            state.


            Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402
            status code if a subscription's first invoice cannot be paid. For
            example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA
            regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does
            not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the
            default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the
            [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn
            more.


            `pending_if_incomplete` is only used with updates and cannot be
            passed when creating a subscription.


            Subscriptions with `collection_method=send_invoice` are
            automatically activated regardless of the first invoice status.

        payment_behavior:
          description: >-
            Use `allow_incomplete` to transition the subscription to
            `status=past_due` if a payment is required but cannot be paid. This
            allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are
            needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation
            may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA
            Migration
            Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication)
            for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.


            Use `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to
            `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit
            confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This allows simpler
            management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to
            pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA
            regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication),
            or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.


            Use `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using
            [pending
            updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates).
            When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the
            parameters [supported by pending
            updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).


            Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402
            status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example,
            if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA
            regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does
            not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was
            the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the
            [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn
            more.
