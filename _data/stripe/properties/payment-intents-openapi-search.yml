        <p>After the PaymentIntent is created, attach a payment method and <a
        href="/docs/api/payment_intents/confirm">confirm</a>

        to continue the payment. Learn more about <a

        with the Payment Intents API</a>.</p>


        <p>When you use <code>confirm=true</code> during creation, it’s
        equivalent to creating

        and confirming the PaymentIntent in the same call. You can use any
        parameters

        available in the <a href="/docs/api/payment_intents/confirm">confirm
        API</a> when you supply

        <code>confirm=true</code>.</p>

        <p>Depending on which properties you update, you might need to confirm
        the

        PaymentIntent again. For example, updating the
        <code>payment_method</code>

        always requires you to confirm the PaymentIntent again. If you prefer to

        update and confirm at the same time, we recommend updating properties
        through

        the <a href="/docs/api/payment_intents/confirm">confirm API</a>
        instead.</p>

        <p>After it’s canceled, no additional charges are made by the
        PaymentIntent and any operations on the PaymentIntent fail with an

    post:

        <p>Confirm that your customer intends to pay with current or provided

        payment method. Upon confirmation, the PaymentIntent will attempt to
        initiate

        a payment.

        If the selected payment method requires additional authentication steps,
        the

        PaymentIntent will transition to the <code>requires_action</code> status
        and

        suggest additional actions via <code>next_action</code>. If payment
        fails,

        the PaymentIntent transitions to the
        <code>requires_payment_method</code> status or the

        <code>canceled</code> status if the confirmation limit is reached. If

        payment succeeds, the PaymentIntent will transition to the
        <code>succeeded</code>

        status (or <code>requires_capture</code>, if <code>capture_method</code>
        is set to <code>manual</code>).

        If the <code>confirmation_method</code> is <code>automatic</code>,
        payment may be attempted

        using our <a
        href="/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-handle-card-payment">client
        SDKs</a>

        and the PaymentIntent’s <a
        href="#payment_intent_object-client_secret">client_secret</a>.

        After <code>next_action</code>s are handled by the client, no additional

        confirmation is required to complete the payment.

        If the <code>confirmation_method</code> is <code>manual</code>, all
        payment attempts must be

        initiated using a secret key.

        If any actions are required for the payment, the PaymentIntent will

        return to the <code>requires_confirmation</code> state

        after those actions are completed. Your server needs to then

        explicitly re-confirm the PaymentIntent to initiate the next payment

        attempt. Read the <a
        href="/docs/payments/payment-intents/web-manual">expanded
        documentation</a>

        <p>Perform an incremental authorization on an eligible

        <a href="/docs/api/payment_intents/object">PaymentIntent</a>. To be
        eligible, the

        PaymentIntent’s status must be <code>requires_capture</code> and

        <a
        href="/docs/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-incremental_authorization_supported">incremental_authorization_supported</a>

        must be <code>true</code>.</p>


        <p>Incremental authorizations attempt to increase the authorized amount
        on

        your customer’s card to the new, higher <code>amount</code> provided.
        Similar to the

        initial authorization, incremental authorizations can be declined. A

        single PaymentIntent can call this endpoint multiple times to further

        increase the authorized amount.</p>


        <p>If the incremental authorization succeeds, the PaymentIntent object

        returns with the updated

        <a
        href="/docs/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount">amount</a>.

        If the incremental authorization fails, a

        <a href="/docs/error-codes#card-declined">card_declined</a> error
        returns, and no other

        fields on the PaymentIntent or Charge update. The PaymentIntent

        object remains capturable for the previously authorized amount.</p>


        <p>Each PaymentIntent can have a maximum of 10 incremental authorization
        attempts, including declines.

        After it’s captured, a PaymentIntent can no longer be incremented.</p>
