      description: >-
        Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or
        bank

        account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly
        from

        your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information
        is

        returned to your server to use. Use our

        [recommended payments integrations](https://stripe.com/docs/payments) to
        perform this process

        on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches
        your server,

        and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.


        If you can't use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens
        using

        the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If

        your integration uses this method, you're responsible for any PCI
        compliance

        that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe.
        Unlike with

        client-side tokenization, your customer's information isn't sent
        directly to

        Stripe, so we can't determine how it's handled or stored.


        You can't store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank
        account

        information for later use, create
        [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers)

        objects or [Custom
        accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#external_accounts).

        [Radar](https://stripe.com/docs/radar), our integrated solution for
        automatic fraud protection,

        performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.
