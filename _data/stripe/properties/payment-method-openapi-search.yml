        <p>Some payment methods such as Apple Pay require additional steps to
        verify a domain. If the requirements weren’t satisfied when the domain
        was created, the payment method will be inactive on the domain.

        The payment method doesn’t appear in Elements for this domain until it
        is active.</p>


        <p>To activate a payment method on an existing payment method domain,
        complete the required validation steps specific to the payment method,
        and then validate the payment method domain with this endpoint.</p>

        <p>Instead of creating a PaymentMethod directly, we recommend using the

        accept a payment immediately or the <a

        payment method details ahead of a future payment.</p>

        <p>Attaches a PaymentMethod object to a Customer.</p>


        <p>To attach a new PaymentMethod to a customer for future payments, we
        recommend you use a <a href="/docs/api/setup_intents">SetupIntent</a>

        or a PaymentIntent with <a
        href="/docs/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage">setup_future_usage</a>.

        These approaches will perform any necessary steps to set up the
        PaymentMethod for future payments. Using the
        <code>/v1/payment_methods/:id/attach</code>

        endpoint without first using a SetupIntent or PaymentIntent with
        <code>setup_future_usage</code> does not optimize the PaymentMethod for

        future use, which makes later declines and payment friction more likely.

        See <a href="/docs/payments/payment-intents#future-usage">Optimizing
        cards for future payments</a> for more information about setting up

        future payments.</p>


        <p>To use this PaymentMethod as the default for invoice or subscription
        payments,

        set <a
        href="/docs/api/customers/update#update_customer-invoice_settings-default_payment_method"><code>invoice_settings.default_payment_method</code></a>,

        on the Customer to the PaymentMethod’s ID.</p>
