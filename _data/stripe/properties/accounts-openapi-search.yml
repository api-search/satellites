        <p>With <a href="/docs/connect">Connect</a>, you can create Stripe
        accounts for your users.

        To do this, you’ll first need to <a
        href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings">register
        your platform</a>.</p>


        <p>If you’ve already collected information for your connected accounts,
        you <a href="/docs/connect/best-practices#onboarding">can prefill that
        information</a> when

        creating the account. Connect Onboarding won’t ask for the prefilled
        information during account onboarding.

        You can prefill any information on the account.</p>

        manage.</p>


        <p>Accounts created using test-mode keys can be deleted at any time.
        Standard accounts created using live-mode keys cannot be deleted. Custom
        or Express accounts created using live-mode keys can only be deleted
        once all balances are zero.</p>


        <p>If you want to delete your own account, use the <a

        tab in your account settings</a> instead.</p>

        <p>For Custom accounts, you can update any information on the account.
        For other accounts, you can update all information until that

        account has started to go through Connect Onboarding. Once you create an
