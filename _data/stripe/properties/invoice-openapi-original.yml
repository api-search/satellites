        <p>At any time, you can preview the upcoming invoice for a customer.
        This will show you all the charges that are pending, including
        subscription renewal charges, invoice item charges, etc. It will also
        show you any discounts that are applicable to the invoice.</p>


        <p>Note that when you are viewing an upcoming invoice, you are simply
        viewing a preview – the invoice has not yet been created. As such, the
        upcoming invoice will not show up in invoice listing calls, and you
        cannot use the API to pay or edit the invoice. If you want to change the
        amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update
        pending invoice items, or update the customer’s discount.</p>


        <p>You can preview the effects of updating a subscription, including a
        preview of what proration will take place. To ensure that the actual
        proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you
        should pass a <code>proration_date</code> parameter when doing the
        actual subscription update. The value passed in should be the same as
        the <code>subscription_proration_date</code> returned on the upcoming
        invoice resource. The recommended way to get only the prorations being
        previewed is to consider only proration line items where
        <code>period[start]</code> is equal to the
        <code>subscription_proration_date</code> on the upcoming invoice
        resource.</p>

            This only works for coupons directly applied to the invoice. To
            apply a coupon to a subscription, you must use the `coupon`

            discounts. To preview the upcoming invoice for a subscription that
            hasn't been created, use `coupon` instead.

        Invoice Items represent the component lines of an
        [invoice](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices). An invoice item is
        added to an

        invoice by creating or updating it with an `invoice` field, at which
        point it will be included as

        [an invoice line item](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/line_item)
        within

        [invoice.lines](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines).


        Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the
        invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined

        with a [subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions).
        Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually
        charge

        or credit the customer’s card only at the end of a regular billing
        cycle. This is useful for combining several charges

        (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your
        usage-based billing totals.

        Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either

        generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.


        They contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems),
        and proration adjustments

        that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).


        If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,

        Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note

        that finalizing the invoice,

        [when
        automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection),
        does

        not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits

        until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last

        webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have

        connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after

        creation to finalize the invoice.


        If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then
        based on your

        [email
        settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),

        Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These

        emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.


        Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the

        amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually

        charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's
        [minimum allowed charge

        per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the

        invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the

        customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.


        More details on the customer's credit balance are

        [here](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance).

        forgive:
          description: >-
            In cases where the source used to pay the invoice has insufficient
            funds, passing `forgive=true` controls whether a charge should be
            attempted for the full amount available on the source, up to the
            amount to fully pay the invoice. This effectively forgives the
            difference between the amount available on the source and the amount
            due. 


            Passing `forgive=false` will fail the charge if the source hasn't
            been pre-funded with the right amount. An example for this case is
            with ACH Credit Transfers and wires: if the amount wired is less
            than the amount due by a small amount, you might want to forgive the
            difference. Defaults to `false`.
