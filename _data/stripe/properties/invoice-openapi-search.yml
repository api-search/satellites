        <p>At any time, you can preview the upcoming invoice for a customer.
        This will show you all the charges that are pending, including
        subscription renewal charges, invoice item charges, etc. It will also
        show you any discounts that are applicable to the invoice.</p>


        <p>Note that when you are viewing an upcoming invoice, you are simply
        viewing a preview – the invoice has not yet been created. As such, the
        upcoming invoice will not show up in invoice listing calls, and you
        cannot use the API to pay or edit the invoice. If you want to change the
        amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update
        pending invoice items, or update the customer’s discount.</p>


        <p>You can preview the effects of updating a subscription, including a
        preview of what proration will take place. To ensure that the actual
        proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you
        should pass a <code>proration_date</code> parameter when doing the
        actual subscription update. The value passed in should be the same as
        the <code>subscription_proration_date</code> returned on the upcoming
        invoice resource. The recommended way to get only the prorations being
        previewed is to consider only proration line items where
        <code>period[start]</code> is equal to the
        <code>subscription_proration_date</code> on the upcoming invoice
        resource.</p>
