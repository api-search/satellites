        <p>Attaches a PaymentMethod object to a Customer.</p>


        <p>To attach a new PaymentMethod to a customer for future payments, we
        recommend you use a <a href="/docs/api/setup_intents">SetupIntent</a>

        or a PaymentIntent with <a
        href="/docs/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage">setup_future_usage</a>.

        These approaches will perform any necessary steps to set up the
        PaymentMethod for future payments. Using the
        <code>/v1/payment_methods/:id/attach</code>

        endpoint without first using a SetupIntent or PaymentIntent with
        <code>setup_future_usage</code> does not optimize the PaymentMethod for

        future use, which makes later declines and payment friction more likely.

        See <a href="/docs/payments/payment-intents#future-usage">Optimizing
        cards for future payments</a> for more information about setting up

        future payments.</p>


        <p>To use this PaymentMethod as the default for invoice or subscription
        payments,

        set <a
        href="/docs/api/customers/update#update_customer-invoice_settings-default_payment_method"><code>invoice_settings.default_payment_method</code></a>,

        on the Customer to the PaymentMethod’s ID.</p>

    payment_method_configuration:
      description: >-
        PaymentMethodConfigurations control which payment methods are displayed
        to your customers when you don't explicitly specify payment method
        types. You can have multiple configurations with different sets of
        payment methods for different scenarios.


        There are two types of PaymentMethodConfigurations. Which is used
        depends on the [charge type](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/charges):


        **Direct** configurations apply to payments created on your account,
        including Connect destination charges, Connect separate charges and
        transfers, and payments not involving Connect.


        **Child** configurations apply to payments created on your connected
        accounts using direct charges, and charges with the on_behalf_of
        parameter.


        Child configurations have a `parent` that sets default values and
        controls which settings connected accounts may override. You can specify
        a parent ID at payment time, and Stripe will automatically resolve the
        connected account’s associated child configuration. Parent
        configurations are [managed in the
        dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods/connected_accounts)
        and are not available in this API.
