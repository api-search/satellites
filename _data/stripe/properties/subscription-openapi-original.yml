        <p>Usage records provide <code>quantity</code> information that Stripe
        uses to track how much a customer is using your service. With usage
        information and the pricing model set up by the <a
        href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/metered-billing">metered
        billing</a> plan, Stripe helps you send accurate invoices to your
        customers.</p>


        <p>The default calculation for usage is to add up all the
        <code>quantity</code> values of the usage records within a billing
        period. You can change this default behavior with the billing plan’s
        <code>aggregate_usage</code> <a
        href="/docs/api/plans/create#create_plan-aggregate_usage">parameter</a>.
        When there is more than one usage record with the same timestamp, Stripe
        adds the <code>quantity</code> values together. In most cases, this is
        the desired resolution, however, you can change this behavior with the
        <code>action</code> parameter.</p>


        <p>The default pricing model for metered billing is <a
        href="/docs/api/plans/object#plan_object-billing_scheme">per-unit
        pricing</a>. For finer granularity, you can configure metered billing to
        have a <a

        <p>Updates an existing subscription to match the specified parameters.

        When changing prices or quantities, we optionally prorate the price we
        charge next month to make up for any price changes.

        To preview how the proration is calculated, use the <a
        href="/docs/api/invoices/upcoming">upcoming invoice</a> endpoint.</p>


        <p>By default, we prorate subscription changes. For example, if a
        customer signs up on May 1 for a <currency>100</currency> price, they’ll
        be billed <currency>100</currency> immediately. If on May 15 they switch
        to a <currency>200</currency> price, then on June 1 they’ll be billed
        <currency>250</currency> (<currency>200</currency> for a renewal of her
        subscription, plus a <currency>50</currency> prorating adjustment for
        half of the previous month’s <currency>100</currency> difference).
        Similarly, a downgrade generates a credit that is applied to the next
        invoice. We also prorate when you make quantity changes.</p>


        <p>Switching prices does not normally change the billing date or
        generate an immediate charge unless:</p>


        <ul>

        <li>The billing interval is changed (for example, from monthly to
        yearly).</li>

        <li>The subscription moves from free to paid, or paid to free.</li>

        <li>A trial starts or ends.</li>

        </ul>


        <p>In these cases, we apply a credit for the unused time on the previous
        price, immediately charge the customer using the new price, and reset
        the billing date.</p>


        <p>If you want to charge for an upgrade immediately, pass
        <code>proration_behavior</code> as <code>always_invoice</code> to create
        prorations, automatically invoice the customer for those proration
        adjustments, and attempt to collect payment. If you pass
        <code>create_prorations</code>, the prorations are created but not
        automatically invoiced. If you want to bill the customer for the
        prorations before the subscription’s renewal date, you need to manually
        <a href="/docs/api/invoices/create">invoice the customer</a>.</p>


        <p>If you don’t want to prorate, set the <code>proration_behavior</code>
        option to <code>none</code>. With this option, the customer is billed
        <currency>100</currency> on May 1 and <currency>200</currency> on June
        1. Similarly, if you set <code>proration_behavior</code> to
        <code>none</code> when switching between different billing intervals
        (for example, from monthly to yearly), we don’t generate any credits for
        the old subscription’s unused time. We still reset the billing date and
        bill immediately for the new subscription.</p>


        <p>Updating the quantity on a subscription many times in an hour may
        result in <a href="/docs/rate-limits">rate limiting</a>. If you need to
        bill for a frequently changing quantity, consider integrating <a
        href="/docs/billing/subscriptions/usage-based">usage-based billing</a>
        instead.</p>

            Possible values are `incomplete`, `incomplete_expired`, `trialing`,

            For `collection_method=charge_automatically` a subscription moves
            into `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt fails. A
            subscription in this state can only have metadata and default_source
            updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into
            an `active` state. If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours,
            the subscription transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is a
            terminal state, the open invoice will be voided and no further
            invoices will be generated. 


            A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and
            moves to `active` when the trial period is over. 


            If subscription `collection_method=charge_automatically`, it becomes
            `past_due` when payment is required but cannot be paid (due to
            failed payment or awaiting additional user actions). Once Stripe has
            exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription will become
            `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings). 


            If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes
            `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and
            `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional
            deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of
            `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be
            created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving
            updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to
            reopen and pay their closed invoices.

            Only applies to subscriptions with

            Use `allow_incomplete` to create subscriptions with
            `status=incomplete` if the first invoice cannot be paid. Creating
            subscriptions with this status allows you to manage scenarios where
            additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription's invoice.
            For example, SCA regulation may require 3DS authentication to
            complete payment. See the [SCA Migration
            Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication)
            for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.


            Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with
            `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment,
            otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to
            `status=active` when successfully confirming the payment intent on
            the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where
            additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice.
            Such as failed payments, [SCA
            regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication),
            or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the
            payment intent is not confirmed within 23 hours subscriptions
            transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal
            state.


            Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402
            status code if a subscription's first invoice cannot be paid. For
            example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA
            regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does
            not create a subscription and returns an error instead. This was the
            default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the
            [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn
            more.


            `pending_if_incomplete` is only used with updates and cannot be
            passed when creating a subscription.


            Subscriptions with `collection_method=send_invoice` are
            automatically activated regardless of the first invoice status.

        payment_behavior:
          description: >-
            Use `allow_incomplete` to transition the subscription to
            `status=past_due` if a payment is required but cannot be paid. This
            allows you to manage scenarios where additional user actions are
            needed to pay a subscription's invoice. For example, SCA regulation
            may require 3DS authentication to complete payment. See the [SCA
            Migration
            Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication)
            for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.


            Use `default_incomplete` to transition the subscription to
            `status=past_due` when payment is required and await explicit
            confirmation of the invoice's payment intent. This allows simpler
            management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to
            pay a subscription’s invoice. Such as failed payments, [SCA
            regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication),
            or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method.


            Use `pending_if_incomplete` to update the subscription using
            [pending
            updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates).
            When you use `pending_if_incomplete` you can only pass the
            parameters [supported by pending
            updates](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/pending-updates-reference#supported-attributes).


            Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402
            status code if a subscription's invoice cannot be paid. For example,
            if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA
            regulation and further user action is needed, this parameter does
            not update the subscription and returns an error instead. This was
            the default behavior for API versions prior to 2019-03-14. See the
            [changelog](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14) to learn
            more.
